#Why Are Corals Bleaching?

For this project, we examined the increasing rate of coral bleaching and its impacts on the Great Barrier Reef in the
last decade. To start, we asked, “what’s causing the coral bleaching in the Great Barrier Reef?”
According to National Public Radio, “Abnormally hot ocean temperatures, as high as 7 degrees Fahrenheit above average,
have stressed the reef” (1). Typically, coral bleaching occurs when the water temperature is too warm and the leading cause
is climate change: an excessive amount of CO2 is being transferred into the ocean, which causes the water temperature to
rise. Among many problems climate change is causing our world, coral bleaching is one of them, and it’s our job to sustain
the health of corals.

#What’s Coral Bleaching?

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration state, “When corals are stressed by changes in conditions such as
temperature, light, or nutrients, they expel the symbiotic algae living in their tissues, causing them to turn completely
white.” (2). Change in average water temperature causes corals to expel the algae living within their tissues (Zooxanthellae)
and turn completely white. Zooxanthellae are crucial to the health of living corals because it provides food for them from a
process called photosynthesis.

#Why Should We Care? (Human Values)

“A quarter of marine species depend on coral reefs at some point in their lives, as do millions of people who depend on reefs
for food, jobs, and shoreline protection from storm surges.” (1) Coral reefs are some of the most diverse and valuable
ecosystems on Earth and according to the NOAA, “Coral reefs support more species per unit area than any other marine environment,
including about 4,000 species of fish, 800 species of hard corals and hundreds of other species” (3). Not only do coral reefs
support thousands of marine species, many drugs are now being developed from coral reef animals and plants as well.
These drugs could be possible cures for cancer, arthritis, human bacterial infections, viruses, and other diseases.
Coral reefs support commercial and subsistence fisheries as well as jobs and businesses through tourism and recreation.
To us, coral reefs are essential for our supply of fisheries. “Approximately half of all federally managed fisheries depend on
coral reefs and related habitats for a portion of their life cycles. The National Marine Fisheries Service estimates the
commercial value of U.S. fisheries from coral reefs is over $100 million” (3). Coral reefs also makes billions of dollars for
local economies. Coral reefs attract visitors through diving tours, recreational fishing trips, hotels, restaurants, and other
businesses based near reef ecosystems.

Lastly, “Coral reef structures also buffer shorelines against 97 percent of the energy from waves, storms, and floods,
helping to prevent loss of life, property damage, and erosion” (3). The natural barrier acts as protection for coastal
communities from normal wave action and violent storms. Replacing these barriers will be costly and without it, the coastal
residents will be at risk.

#Who’s At Stake?
Directly, coral bleaching causes harm for the corals and the marine life that depends on the coral and the reefs for survival.
But indirectly, there are many stakes to the human economy and their well-being.
